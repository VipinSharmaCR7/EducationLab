What is EduLabs ?

EduLabs is an interactive educational app which allows students to access their personal labs and helps them carry

out practicals in times like these when online education is the major medium of education.

Inspiration

The online medium has taken over the education industry. The students face difficulty in getting access to the

laboratory education. There are many simulation softwares which make the work easy but none get them as far as

giving them a real-life experience. So, we propose EduLabs as an alternative to the online laboratory education.

What doesEduLabs do?

EduLabs empowers the students to visualize the laboratory education through an immersive Augmented Reality(AR)

experience. Students can learn at their pace at the comfort of their homes. All this is made possible through

a mobile application without any additional burden.
